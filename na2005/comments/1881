	<p><em><strong>dcd</strong> replies:</em> It just goes to show that if people can come to this site and either beg us to vote or state that they voted, then can they be trusted to vote at all?</p> <p>They cannot seem to understand how simple things work, they cannot follow the instructions on the tin.</p> <p>... and we give them the freedom to dawdle along to the polling station -- no doubt to pick a candidate on an equally fallacious basis!</p> <p>Good Grief! *rolls eyes*</p>

	<p><em><strong>Tiger43</strong> replies:</em> To poster.......Thats true regarding the original purpose of this site. However because of peoples various and diverse opinions on politics etc, its only natural that some opinions and points will vere from the original point of the whole idea.</p> <p>Which is good really. It just goes to show how healthy and mixed peoples views are. I have read a few and some have gone into football and cheese! Amazing eh. </p>

		<h2>About Not Apathetic</h2>
<p>NotApathetic was built so that people who are planning not to vote
in the <acronym title="United Kingdom">UK</acronym> General Election
on May 5th can tell the world why. We won't try to persuade you that
voting is a good or a bad idea - we're just here to record and share
your explanations. Whether ideological,	practical or other, any	reason
will do.</p>

<!--<p><a href="/cgi-bin/similarity.cgi">Help us spot patterns in
submitted reasons</a> (by telling us whether two posts are similar or
not)</p>-->

<small>A lot of users would like us to
mention that if you spoil your ballot paper, it <em>will</em>
be counted. So if you want to record a vote for "none of the
above", you can.</small>
