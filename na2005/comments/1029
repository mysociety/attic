	<p><em><strong>Andy</strong> replies:</em> Parliament isn't dissolved, the system works in Austrlia and New Zealand (where they have almost a 100% voter turnout) and if 45% vote no confidence, then the election is void and the parties have to do it all again.  It's never happened in either country, and probably because the parties are so aware of the consequences, they actually get their act together.  In this country, the problem isn't tackled becuase it's much easier to get a small minority of the country to vote for you than it would be an actual majority</p>

	<p><em><strong>Ed</strong> replies:</em> You make some good points, Andy, but I am not convinced that the parties in Australia "got their act together"; in the most recent election, it appears that economic stability, combined with a dash of xenophobia, won out over an untried and potentially less fiscally-responsible opposition.</p> <p>Also, one could argue that because people HAVE to vote, plenty of the electorate will be apathetic and largely uninformed - this inevitably turns the contest into something staid and simplistic, with "dog whistle" policy pronouncements (now imported to the Tory campaign from Oz) designed to swing the outcome your way... this would not necessarily rank as an improvement.</p>

	<p><em><strong>Andy</strong> replies:</em> Although in Australia there is a fine if you don't vote, in New Zealand this isn't the case, and yet they still get a 97% voter turn-out!  They also have a larger number of referendums, (generally about 1 between every election) and I believe that this is another reason why people vote as they feel that their opinions actually count.</p>

		<h2>About Not Apathetic</h2>
<p>NotApathetic was built so that people who are planning not to vote
in the <acronym title="United Kingdom">UK</acronym> General Election
on May 5th can tell the world why. We won't try to persuade you that
voting is a good or a bad idea - we're just here to record and share
your explanations. Whether ideological,	practical or other, any	reason
will do.</p>

<!--<p><a href="/cgi-bin/similarity.cgi">Help us spot patterns in
submitted reasons</a> (by telling us whether two posts are similar or
not)</p>-->

<small>A lot of users would like us to
mention that if you spoil your ballot paper, it <em>will</em>
be counted. So if you want to record a vote for "none of the
above", you can.</small>
