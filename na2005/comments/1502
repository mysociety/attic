	<p><em><strong>rayyan</strong> replies:</em> Original poster want us to believe he is moslem but it appears that he is the most ignorant person claiming to be moslem. Since when Islam is against democracy. If your brand of Islam is originating from incorrect interpretation of Islamic teaching, then you should consider that even in Saudi Arabia elections are now being held for local bodies. Atleast, thats a begining. When moslems had open minds, they were flourishing. Modern maths, algebra, astronomy, medicine and many other sciences have been given to the world by moslems. It is only the present days stupid followers who have brought a bad name to a religion which Allah Subhan (the All mighty God) bestowed upon the world as the religion closed to the nature of mankind and for all times. Only if we think and ponder, an instruction which came time and again in Koran. </p>

	<p><em><strong>charlotte</strong> replies:</em> As a student of history I studied the origins of Islam, and the first Muslim community in Mecca. If you read Ibn Ishaq's life of the Prophet you'll see that Muhammad created a tolerant, fair community in which those of other faiths had a right to membership. Quoting obscure parts of the Quran just proves that you have no concept of the history of your faith. Democracy does not run against the precepts of Islam, and if you believe it does perhaps you should seek counsel with one better versed in the text.</p>

	<p><em><strong>mehkri</strong> replies:</em> suhaib: since I am not orthodox, I have not come across any where in Quran or Hadith or writings of Iman Abu Hanifa (to the extent that I have read) that democracy is against Islam. In fact the first Hazrat Abu Bakar, upon his becoming first caliph, stood up and took consent of people. So did other caliphs. The concept of passsing rules with in the family came from Hazrat Abu Mawiya - the time when islamic democracy died. In Islam, their in no ban on ijtihad to find solutions to the problems of the time. That is why the learned Imams of the times kept on ijtihad. They did not shut their minds to the changing world. Quran is for all times - however, just presenting verses out of context is not going to help people understand Islam. What do you think the Sahaba-e-Karam did in Habsha. Ponder and you might come to find ways to living and presenting the true islamic way of life in non-moslem countries. </p>

	<p><em><strong>Suhabib Hasan</strong> replies:</em> Mehkri - my point was quite simple. There is not one single " authority" or interpretation on the teachings of Islam.

	<p><em><strong>suhabib Hasan</strong> replies:</em> Democracy may indeed be closer to Islam but this is like saying a man is closer to the stars because he stands on a mountain. <br />It may be true but misses the point.</p> <p>I have accepted into my heart that only Allah the Compassionate, the Merciful can be our authority and guide. <br />As has been stated elsewhere - "Democracy is a Greek word meaning the rule of the people, which means that the people do what they see fit, this concept is considered apostasy and defies the belief in one God ." </p> <p>I can't accept the authority of a democratic government  that demonised Muslims as an enemy. A democratic government that may, can and is introducing laws that legitimise and protects concepts I reject in persuit of my  faith. </p> <p>Democracy in general is a gloss sheen placed on a greedy and brutal world that is consumed with prsonal gain and the desire for objects.</p> <p>The last two elections in America have been criticised by indendent writers of honour as being abused and corrupted. </p> <p>There is a growing corruption involved in the postal voting in the UK.</p> <p>As Muslims we must ask ourselves where does our religion end and politics begin? </p> <p></p>

	<p><em><strong>mehkri</strong> replies:</em> Sohaib: obviously, you quoted nothing from Quran or Hadiths, so I rest my case. </p> <p>As for frauds, the islamic teachings are quite clear with regards to the rights of mankind (Haqooq-ul-ibad). </p> <p>But by claiming democracy is against the teaching of Islams is not doing justice to the cause of moslems.

	<p><em><strong>John Knox</strong> replies:</em> mehkri, you're wasting your time with this loser - I don't believe for a minute that he is even a Muslim - he's just an idiot <em>pretending</em> to be Muslim in order to deliberately provoke a negative response from non-Muslims.</p> <p>Look back at his response to your comment <em>neem mulla khatra-e-iman</em> - he doesn't have a clue what this means, so he looked it up on the internet (only one site uses the phrase, unfortunately for him) and cut-and-paste it directly from there - see http://tinyurl.com/dkgeh. Go on, ask him exactly what <em>neem mulla khatra-e-iman</em> means - it should be a laugh.</p> <p>Similarly, all his quotes from the Qur'an are cut-and-pasted from websites without much thought for their content - and notice how, after making his initial bold statement, he has quoted nothing appropriate from the Qur'an to back up his "arguments" - he's obviously struggling to find the right websites to copy from, the big fraud.</p> <p></p>

	<p><em><strong>Suhabib Hasan</strong> replies:</em> John Knox - you stand judgemnet over me?<br />I know the saying well and  would translate it as (not by any means an exact translation) - the use of imperfect knowledge makes you a foolish man.<br />I am sure there is a similar phrase in English - it is the sort of thing I am sure Scottish or Irish people would say.</p> <p>I am not searching for any quotations. I am actually quite distracted by my work - where I am at the moment.</p> <p>I have entered a secular website looking for reasons people will not vote in the coming election. <br />It has been pointed out to me by a couple of contributors that using quotations is not as fruitful as making direct clear statements - so I am doing that.</p> <p>John - do not abuse me any more.</p>

	<p><em><strong>Thomas Cochrane</strong> replies:</em> I have been following this thread and have come to the conclusion (perhaps wrongly) that Suhaib is someone who has returned to Islam. Perhaps having grown up in a comfortable western lifestyle.<br />Dad a doctor or in the financial sector? Islam not really an important part of family life.</p> <p>He had all the luxuries anyone could ask for and in late teenage or early 20's was deeply involved in all the excesses the secular life has to offer. Flashy car, nightclubs, drugs, girls.</p> <p>He has recently rediscovered his Islamic roots and is catching up. </p> <p>He is perhaps (as was stated earlier) someone who has little knowledge or understanding of Islam - and the little knowledge he has he like to stretch to cover his conception of the world.</p> <p>Am I anywhere near the truth Suhaib?<br /></p>

	<p><em><strong>pedant</strong> replies:</em> No, as John originally pointed out, this fellow is simply a troll (no need for a question mark, troll - you can look it up on google just like everything else you paste here). </p> <p>And, as george already pointed out, the incompetent facade is further degraded by the fact that his chosen pseudonym mutated from "Suhaib Hasan" to "Suhabib Hasan", until george highlighted it - whereupon it mutated back. Blaming the autocomplete function for this transgression is patently absurd (after all, autcomplete autocompletes. It doesn't insert arbitrary letters at will).</p> <p>No doubt this tirade of pointless drivel will end with an insult and the disappearance of said "poster", who will unfortunately probably re-emerge from the dusky shadows of boredom and mediocrity with a new nickname in a further effort to waste away some of the remaining hours of his futile existence. </p> <p>It's not as if politics were not inane enough already.</p> <p></p>

	<p><em><strong>Tom</strong> replies:</em> This probably the funniest thread I've found on this site, so I've been induced into comment.  I notice Suhaib/Suhabib/moron has disappeared.  COME BACK MATE! I was enjoying the laugh...  </p> <p>There's quite a lot of atheistic argument at the end there which, as a scientist, I can't resist getting dragged into.  I particularly want to comment about what "the only sane..." has to say about the origins of religion.  Of course you are right mate, but why get bogged down with all that explanation.  You can do away with the actual concept of religion in one fell swoop, as such:</p> <p>Believing in something you have no evidence for is just a faith, and is therefore both irrational and illogical (it's not based on known fact).  Here I would hope even the religious would agree.  However, any beliefs based on illogical foundations have no place in a well constructed argument.  Even if a god(s) does exist it simply isn't sensible to believe in him/them.  You could choose to believe that a big lump of cheese created the universe, the Platonic doctrine of science forces us to consider EVERYTHING as possible, doesn't mean it's very likely, probable or that there's anyway to justify your belief in it.<br /></p>

	<p><em><strong>Tom W</strong> replies:</em> Ahh young one, you have misundersood.  The Quorn is not a prophet but the teaching of the prophet mozzerella (thanks Harry).  He teaches us of the stringy nature of things.  String theory describes the whole universe.</p>

	<p><em><strong>disagreed</strong> replies:</em> Although I accept the validity* of the opinion of "the only sane guy in the village", and appreciate his (or her) contribution, I would like to severely criticize the views expressed by 'agreed', '__' and Al, which show gross misunderstanding and bigotry.</p> <p>People with religious views *must* be allowed to express their opinions, otherwise you are removing their democratic rights.  Racists and British colonialists would have been delighted if Martin Luther King Jr or Gandi had been refused political rights because their involvement was politically motivated.</p> <p>"muslims in my opinion seem to biggest load of hypocrites out there" - but then so are you, if you think that destroying religion will solve all the world's problems.  Think of Russia and China, where removing all religion from government has done nothing to make government less willing to oppress people.</p> <p>Please don't succumb to tarnishing all Muslims with the same brush.  Very few western Muslims promote violence to advance their religion.  Several Muslim-majority countries are on their way to democracy - Turkey and Iraq for example, and most violent groups can be better understood as social and national conflicts, rather than directly motivated by religion.  If Palestine had a democracy, instead of despots indoctrinating people with anti-Israel and anti-semitic propaganda, there wouldn't be suicide bombers.  Further, who made those AK-47s in the first place?  Tell me that, '__'.</p> <p>______________________________________<br />* (i.e. it's his democratic right, and it's a well-reasoned opinion held by many 'reasonable' people that religion must be kept to oneself, though I do personally disagree with it)</p>

	<p><em><strong>Tom W</strong> replies:</em> Rob, yeah I think it wasn't meant too seriously.  I agree with all your points about freedom of beliefs, but politics should be separated from religion.  Look at the states, where they now have ministers informing their congregation who god wants them to vote for.  The product is the neo-cons and their programme of fear breeding.</p> <p>Also, your points about palestine seem a little biased to me.  Are you Jewish by any chance? The suicide bombers are there because thier country is being occupied by an aggressor.  Some would call it freedom fighting.  By the way, my family is Jewish so I don't want hear any anti-semitic allegations.  There simply is no excuse for the attitude of Israel, or the aid and tolerance they recieve from western powers.</p>

	<p><em><strong>Tom W</strong> replies:</em> Oh, and by the way, the idea that the palestine situation is not motivated by religion is ridiculous.  It a fight for the holy land.  That's what has been contested for the last 1000 years.</p>

	<p><em><strong>sane guy</strong> replies:</em> Hmmm I think the point being made really is that religion and politics don't mix.</p> <p>Also that many people interpret religious doctrines in a way that will suit their own ends.</p> <p>Whether that be crazy jihads,<br />or stupid christian crusades.<br />It's all the same thing.</p> <p>The main thing I disagree with is the way in which young people are indoctrinated into a religion before they have had chance to make a reasoned decision.<br />This happens with all the major religions.<br />In my view it is tantamount to brainwashing.</p> <p>- The Sane non believer</p>

	<p><em><strong>Chris</strong> replies:</em> How come when peolpe make an example of something absurd to believe in, it's always cheese? maybe because it's not so absurd. maybe it's because we are all subconciously aware of the Greater Cheese Being, which, in my opinion, has to be Cheddar, but I won't judge others if they believe differently. Except for Quorn.</p>

in the <acronym title="United Kingdom">UK</acronym> General Election
on May 5th can tell the world why. We won't try to persuade you that
voting is a good or a bad idea - we're just here to record and share
your explanations. Whether ideological,	practical or other, any	reason
will do.</p>

<!--<p><a href="/cgi-bin/similarity.cgi">Help us spot patterns in

<small>A lot of users would like us to
mention that if you spoil your ballot paper, it <em>will</em>
be counted. So if you want to record a vote for "none of the
above", you can.</small>
