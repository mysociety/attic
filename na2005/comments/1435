	<p><em><strong>Loony Liberal</strong> replies:</em> My heart bleeds for you. Yet again the government has refused to give students the beer money they so badly need, forcing them to drink themselves into debt. If the Lib Dems come to power, we guarantee £5000 a year beer money and a Pot Noodle for every student in Britain. We will also hug you.</p>

	<p><em><strong>Jon</strong> replies:</em> Of course it is possible to be a student, to be hard working, to buy books for reference, and to be rewarded with debt.  Perhaps it is true that students do drink themselves stupid, but we are also the ones who are supposed to study full time to try and sort out the mess we inherit.  Some do, some don't; I wouldn't mind the money given to me to buy books and access to academic journals instead of having to live the life of the working man, what's the problem with 'money' anyway, when did money become the deciding feature in a society.  I suppose the alternative is to treat universities as a filter to get slightly more adept office fodder to keep the businesses profitable.  Ole! To the end of the world!</p>

	<p><em><strong>Sarah</strong> replies:</em> My loan didn't even cover my accomodation costs, never mind tuition fees, books, food etc. This idea that all student debt comes from drinking every last penny away is ridiculous, and, from what I've seen, mainly held by the over 30s and those who've never been to university. I'm 20, don't drink, don't smoke, don't do drugs and shop secondhand and last summer I was still lucky enough to receive final demands for repayment of my £1800 overdraft (which went on rent) to be paid off in 14 days.  Instead of claiming all student money goes on beer, take the time to compare the average loan with the average cost of rent, tuition fees, books and other such essentials - it doesn't add up quite the way you seem to assume it does.</p>

	<p><em><strong>Well-off Graduate</strong> replies:</em> I'd like to defend our student for hanging onto his PC when destitute in all other ways. An old PC is worth next-to-nothing, but its a huge enabling device. Without the Internet, the time and money required to try and find a job, or just day-to-day information or a job multiply hugely. And if it weren't for his PC, we wouldn't have even heard his opinion.<br />When I'm living in a cardboard box, it'll be one near an unsecured wi-fi point, and they'll prise my 3-year old laptop from my dead fingers.</p>

	<p><em><strong>Gavin</strong> replies:</em> I had plenty of money at uni (well, enough at least). I got the maximum loan and didn't need any money from my parents. I did work through the summer holidays to help cover costs. To be fair, my course did not require many books (Computer Science). The area was also reasonably cheap rent-wise (I was paying around £60/month).</p> <p>There are certainly students who have a lot of expenses, unusually high rent costs or wealthy but tight parents who can get into trouble. But from my experience, the "poor" students were poor because they blew their money on over-expensive food, drink and toys. There were exceptions, you cannot tar everyone with the same brush, but for me £3,500 was plenty of money to live on for 8-9 months. I also don't mind paying the loan bak, either - the qualifications are worth it.</p> <p>If you drop out I suppose you're in trouble, too - I wonder if our original poster did that, as he doesn't describe himself as a "graduate". Again, there are cases of bad luck or whatever, but in most cases a course change is an option.</p>

	<p><em><strong>Tiger43</strong> replies:</em> To Well-Off Graduate.....Thats just the way it should be. You should have to struggle through life, how else are you going to learn that life is tough and sometimes kicks you when your`e down. I say learn these facts while your`e still young, so your are more prepared for it when your`e older. I should know, I read it on the back of a matchbox!</p>
