	<p><em><strong>Nick</strong> replies:</em> Bad news.  If you like a nice cuppa tea, emigration isn't such an attractive option.</p> <p>When you've lived in England, you really don't much fancy what passes for tea elsewhere.  When you've lived in Italy, you don't much fancy what passes for coffee elsewhere.  You might want to lose that caffeine habit!</p>

	<p><em><strong>Max</strong> replies:</em> Strictly for the birds?<br />Have you noticed how the words "immigration" and "emigration" are bandied about without their demeaning significance being realised?<br />Birds migrate, workers emigrate and immigrate, but the wealthy capitalist class "take up residence".</p>

	<p><em><strong>biscuit</strong> replies:</em> i'm migrating.</p> <p>thank you Britain for my excellent education, my degree. now i have a student debt of £12000, so i'm off to distant shores from where i can ridicule you Britain, and never pay back a penny you've so generously spent on me. My loan will be wiped out when i'm finally declared bankrupt next month, so if I do fancy visiting these shores again, the tax man can go F himself.</p> <p>What else do you want me to do? Live in a country governed by Dr Evil himself George Bush. I don't think so. Stay and work for a system that makes life easier for the rich, and harder for the poor. Exist in this dull, retail therapy society with no culture or reason for existance? I'll enjoy myself very much making a life in Brasil thank you very much. My education will be much more worthwhile there.</p> <p>So I'm not voting, one, because I'm out of here forever, and two, because we didn't even get to vote in the election that decided the government to lead our truly 'democratic' country. It happened in 2004, about 5000 miles west of here.</p>

		<h2>About Not Apathetic</h2>
<p>NotApathetic was built so that people who are planning not to vote
in the <acronym title="United Kingdom">UK</acronym> General Election
on May 5th can tell the world why. We won't try to persuade you that
voting is a good or a bad idea - we're just here to record and share
your explanations. Whether ideological,	practical or other, any	reason
will do.</p>

<!--<p><a href="/cgi-bin/similarity.cgi">Help us spot patterns in
submitted reasons</a> (by telling us whether two posts are similar or
not)</p>-->

<small>A lot of users would like us to
mention that if you spoil your ballot paper, it <em>will</em>
be counted. So if you want to record a vote for "none of the
above", you can.</small>
