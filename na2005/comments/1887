	<p><em><strong>Al</strong> replies:</em> dcd is just pissed off because he wanted to see his vote count, his vote being the 'non of the above vote'. He shouldn't be too pissed off though because that vote still got the biggest majority. The fact is many people do find a party that represents their views, it's good to see a decent turn out.</p>

	<p><em><strong>dcd</strong> replies:</em> Hey Tiger43 (Grrr etc)... now "don't take this the wrong way", but it is merely a statistical fact that some people are intellectually challenged, some people are very bright and smart, and most of us are of average intelligence.  It's one of those natural laws, bell curves and standard deviations from the mean blah blah (i.e. nothing personal, completely objective observation).</p> <p>We do not have a democracy in this country.  Simple fact, indeed self-evidently so.  No argument.</p> <p>We may have a democratic input, but that's the best we can say about it.</p> <p>Fair enough?</p> <p>Now, the question is whether or not we SHOULD have some kind of "full blown" democracy in this country... given that we have this bell curve.</p> <p>It is a given that the brightest lights would probably not vote, and so the "turn out" is entirely dependent upon the remaining two broad groups (the average thinker and the idiot -- a term, by the way, not used disparagingly, but correctly).</p> <p>We can only conclude that these groups have been influenced to vote in some way -- perhaps through the habit of voting on Saturday night TV shows, or by the increase in the lottery and texting competitions.</p> <p>Perhaps it is this, combined with the ever decreasing standard of education (i.e. they don't actually know what their vote is FOR, how to go about making the decision, and what happens as a result).</p> <p>I therefore stand by what I said in my earlier comment.</p> <p>To Al... yes, I can see that my comment could possibly be taken as an expression of my being "pissed off", however, I'm not.</p> <p>I cannot in my wildest dreams imagine that enough people would understand let alone care about the poor level of public service our bizarre and ill-fitting political system offers.</p> <p>I accept that most people are cannot imagine any other option -- that they think we are "stuck with it" come hell or high water.</p> <p>This means that they are apathetic or consciously trying to work within the system provided in a vain attempt to make a better world.</p> <p>For me, I actually do believe that everyone involved in religion and politics is trying in their own ways to make a better world, and I respect that, and admire them all for trying.</p> <p>The differences lie in how they go about it, and what they consider to be "better".</p> <p>I am no different in these respects; however, I believe that the systems we have had in place for centuries have served their purposes and outlived them.  They should be replaced completely -- and comrehensively with something else, something tailored to the modern world, it's people and how they wish to live.</p> <p>I seriously do not think we need to think up changes for changes sake or to justify jobs.  I suspect that we could do very well indeed with a much smaller political system of government, and we could manage better the democratic input where and when required to create a better world for ourselves cheaply and efficiently.</p> <p>Throughout history, radical change only comes about when enough people are "pissed off" at the same time.</p> <p>We are so comfortable that I do not envisage my radical dreams of becoming an option.</p> <p>At the end of the day, however inefficient, out-moded, expensive and irrational our systems are, things 'ain't bad enough for a revolution!</p> <p>So, if most people (voters or not) are happy to throw money away on it, accept the lack of accountability, responsibility, training, quality, efficiency, effectiveness and so forth... then so be it.</p> <p>I have no public forum other than my big fat mouth and the occasional internet forum to express my views, for I do not vote (remember)?</p>

	<p><em><strong>Tiger43</strong> replies:</em> To dcd.......Yes I agree with your statement that in a country that is as wealthy as our own, despite general disatisfaction with people, there will be no general uprising by the people or change in the way we are governed, short of a world depresssion, as in the 30`s for example. </p> <p>It would take something quite major I should think to cause the public as a whole to rise up, if thats the right way to put it. Thus causing  political change of sorts.</p> <p>Iv`e allways thought that a good revoltion in a countrys history every now and again is probably a good thing. Largely because the general populous are really pissed off for a particularily good reason.</p> <p>We are a wealthy nation, so such a thing simply isn`t going to happen, so there will be no change to the political system that we have. I would like to see change, however not by the manner I mentioned above. People will voice there concerns etc, but if the majority are comfortable enough, thats as far as it will go. Allot of disaproval, certainly no uprising to change the system.</p>
