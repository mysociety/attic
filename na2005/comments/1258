	<p><em><strong>neil</strong> replies:</em> The party may not win the election but your local green candidate might be able to win a your seat, or even just a good share of the vote gaining support for the cause. </p> <p>it make the statement "people are concerned about green issues the green party manage x number of votes in the election."</p> <p>my problem is not that i don't think my favoured party won't get in it more that i don't have a favoured party</p>

	<p><em><strong>Adam</strong> replies:</em> Why not become involved in winning support for the Green Party outside of your vote? I know it sounds cheesy, but Ghandi said "be the change that you want to see in the world".</p> <p>Or maybe you know or could contact someone in Brighton. In Brighton the Green Party are pushing to have a candidate elected, because the party is strong there. You could swap your vote with someone who lives in Brighton who doesn't support the Green Party. For example, if they were a Labour supporter, you could vote Labour while they vote Green. That way your vote is less "futile".</p>

	<p><em><strong>Claire</strong> replies:</em> If you support the Green Party and they have no chance of winning it is still worth voting for them for two reasons.  Firstly, although not single issue the Green Party is crtainly focussed on a specific area of policy, ie environmentally friendly policies.  By voting Green, even if they do not get in, you would be demostrating your support for environmental policies, encouraging the other parties to pay more attention to these issues and moving them up the policy agenda.</p> <p>The second reason is slightly more practical.  To stand in a General Election a candidate must put down a deposit of £500.  To get the deposit back it is necessary to poll 5% of the vote (thank to the Channel 4 jargon buster for this information).  Even if the Green Party candidate can not get elected, by voting and campaigniing for them you may help them get over the 5% hurdle and save the deposit.</p>

	<p><em><strong>Peter Barber</strong> replies:</em> Here's a positive reason for you to go out and vote: if the overall results on two major political questionnaire sites (<a>Who Should You Vote For?</a> and <a>Who Do I Vote For?</a>) are representative, the Greens would be the <em>main opposition party</em> to a Lib-Dem government. In other words, a hell of a lot of people share your views!</p>

	<p><em><strong>FSOBR</strong> replies:</em> I agree with Claire - it becomes an ideological vote of areas that you are interested / support - and even though it is unlikely that they will gain a seat let alone seats it actually gives a voice to an area that the whole world is begining to worry about...<br /></p>

	<p><em><strong>To Peter Barber</strong> replies:</em> The results of Who Should I Vote For are very exciting. Would Parliament look like that in fifty or sixty years, I wonder? Unfortunately, average people who stick to Labour and/or Conservative and don't pay much attention to anyone else don't tend to take internet quizzes, it's probably mostly younger people in their late teens or twenties I suspect. So maybe we will see a Lib/Green parliament in fifty years? Sounds futuristic.</p>

	<p><em><strong>Hamish Allan</strong> replies:</em> I stopped reading at "I would like Green party". Well, not really, but that was when it stopped qualifying as a reason not to vote. With all the disenfranchised electors out there, consider yourself lucky that you are still able to vote for a party that represents your politics. I know I do, and that's why I'll be voting Green too.<br /></p>
