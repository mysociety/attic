	<dd><p>Im not voting because Ive been disenfranchised which is unfair since the UK pension is the foundation of my income, and doubly unfair because I am being cheated out of the annual uprating which I paid for in a working lifetime of contributions to the NIF. Without a vote I have no way of registering a protest at the freezing of my pension. Which party would I choose if I had the vote? Sixty or more Conservatives have supported our campaign to end pensions freezing, but the leadership is equivocal. Twelve years ago a high profile Labour MP wrote to me that it was his partys policy to give us our uprating. Labour was elected to power, the MP became Pensions Minister and today he is Party Chairman, but he has done nothing to implement his promise. So Labour cannot be trusted. Only the LibDems in their 1993 Manifesto made a clear commitment to us which has never been withdrawn, and Party Leader Charles Kennedy said recently We have shown that we can stick to our principles.<br />I would give them a chance, but I would get from the LibDem candidate a personal pledge to stick to the partys undertaking to abolish pensions freezing to prove that voters can rely on their promises.<br /></p>

		<h2>About Not Apathetic</h2>
<p>NotApathetic was built so that people who are planning not to vote
in the <acronym title="United Kingdom">UK</acronym> General Election
on May 5th can tell the world why. We won't try to persuade you that
voting is a good or a bad idea - we're just here to record and share
your explanations. Whether ideological,	practical or other, any	reason
will do.</p>

<!--<p><a href="/cgi-bin/similarity.cgi">Help us spot patterns in
submitted reasons</a> (by telling us whether two posts are similar or
not)</p>-->

<small>A lot of users would like us to
mention that if you spoil your ballot paper, it <em>will</em>
be counted. So if you want to record a vote for "none of the
above", you can.</small>
