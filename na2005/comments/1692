	<dd><p>Disenfranchised, as usual.</p> <p>I'm not voting because I haven't got the vote.  I have moved house too recently (mid-March) to be on the electoral register.</p> <p>This is the fourth of six elections since I reached voting age when I have been similarly denied the vote.  So I can truly say that none of the buggers represent me.  Not even in theory.  And it's not my fault (I moved house because I had to: my former landlady is hoping to sell my previous flat before the housing bubble collapses, and gave me notice to leave).</p> <p>Would I vote if I could?  Well, I'm in a very marginal constituency (Torridge and West Devon).  I couldn't bring myself to vote for either of the parties with a serious chance, but we do have a very credible Green candidate.</p>

	<p><em><strong>Paul Clark</strong> replies:</em> Just because you miss the letter they send every year doesn't mean you can't get on the register. As I understand it, all you need to do is contact your local returning officer or council etc. and ask them to sort it out. It is fairly easy. I changed which contituency i was registered to vote in at the start of April.</p>

	<p><em><strong>Nick</strong> replies:</em> I did ask the council.  They told me I was too late.</p> <p>Oh, and I forgot to say: I'm not even polled.  ICM (pollsters) 'phoned this afternoon, but said they weren't interested in my views if I wasn't going to vote.</p>

	<p><em><strong>Bill</strong> replies:</em> You can still vote at the polling station for your old address if you were registered.  Its too latew now to do that by post as you've missed the closing date but you could go there on the day.</p>

	<p><em><strong>Nick</strong> replies:</em> I probably could.</p> <p>As it happens, it's just (by the width of one road) over the border into another constituency (South West Devon).  I'd have to be dedidacted indeed to make that journey just to find out whether they recognise me, and if so spoil my ballot paper.</p> <p>And if I did vote there, it would comprehensively give the lie to that strange notion that constituency MPs somehow represent people in their constituency.  Of course, for an area like West Devon, they can't even live here most of the time, which is why the Westminster parliament only *ever* represents the interests of London and the Home Counties.</p> <p>If a candidate proposed to abolish the Westminster Club, I'd be inclined to vote for them!</p>

		<h2>About Not Apathetic</h2>
<p>NotApathetic was built so that people who are planning not to vote
in the <acronym title="United Kingdom">UK</acronym> General Election
on May 5th can tell the world why. We won't try to persuade you that
voting is a good or a bad idea - we're just here to record and share
your explanations. Whether ideological,	practical or other, any	reason
will do.</p>

<!--<p><a href="/cgi-bin/similarity.cgi">Help us spot patterns in
submitted reasons</a> (by telling us whether two posts are similar or
not)</p>-->

<small>A lot of users would like us to
mention that if you spoil your ballot paper, it <em>will</em>
be counted. So if you want to record a vote for "none of the
above", you can.</small>
