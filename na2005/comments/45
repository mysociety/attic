	<p><em><strong>Eric</strong> replies:</em> It may undermine the mandate, though I doubt that, but what does it do to actually change the system? It strikes me as that the technique is vote whinging. If you can't find a party that represents you, why don't you start one?</p>

	<p><em><strong>Steve</strong> replies:</em> If ENOUGH people do it, instead of simply not turning out to vote, the mandate (not just of the winning party but of parliament generally) is inevitably undermined and the system would have to be changed.</p> <p>Starting a new party to represent your views sounds like a good idea in theory, but you have overlooked the fact that our political system was designed to (and largely still succeeds in) protecting the interests of the two main parties and their various cronies.</p> <p>Look how long it took the LibDems to gain any kind of foothold - the problems of this country are much more urgent than that !!</p>

	<p><em><strong>Gareth</strong> replies:</em> It is a very British attitude to  winge and do nothing constructive and this is what Not voting is as far as I can see.  I quote All that is necessary for the triumph of evil is that good men do nothing All systems and organisations can change. It terms of political organisation there is a balancing act to be understood.  Rapid political change causes instability, long term organic growth is the best solution.  I agree that the current political parties are not representitive. The only way to change things is to make your choice based on your best bet (MP) and then start educating and communicating with them. Pick the one who will listen/change.  The question is how can you get them to change not "I'm not joining in so there" How many times have you contacted or contributed to the political arena. Them and us needs to change to us.  If enough people were politically active then change is possible. There is no magic wand.</p>

	<p><em><strong>Zak</strong> replies:</em> "and the system would have to be changed."</p> <p>If you want to change the system then you could vote and/or support LibDem. They'd offer a vote on PR for the House of Commons.  </p> <p></p>

		<h2>About Not Apathetic</h2>
<p>NotApathetic was built so that people who are planning not to vote
in the <acronym title="United Kingdom">UK</acronym> General Election
on May 5th can tell the world why. We won't try to persuade you that
voting is a good or a bad idea - we're just here to record and share
your explanations. Whether ideological,	practical or other, any	reason
will do.</p>

<!--<p><a href="/cgi-bin/similarity.cgi">Help us spot patterns in
submitted reasons</a> (by telling us whether two posts are similar or
not)</p>-->

<small>A lot of users would like us to
mention that if you spoil your ballot paper, it <em>will</em>
be counted. So if you want to record a vote for "none of the
above", you can.</small>
