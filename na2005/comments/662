	<p><em><strong>Anonymous</strong> replies:</em> "I would urge everyone to spoil their vote rather than not vote."</p> <p>Yeah, and in so doing legitimise the election results because the Parties can say "How wonderful, we have a 70% voter turnout" (never mind that two thirds of that 70% spoiled their ballots).</p> <p>The winning party can then say "we have been given a mandate from the public to govern" and your spoiled ballot would have contributed to that, because spoiled ballots are still counted as votes.</p> <p>There is no differentiation made on the type of spoiling, whether it be illegible, the person was too stupid to know how to fill it in, or it was a protest vote for no particular candidate.</p> <p>If you really want to make a difference, register to vote so that you are eligable, but then don't vote at all on the day. Low turnout is what scares the politicians the most, because it shows to the whole country just how few people actually support them.</p> <p>A government elected by only say, only 20% of the population can in no way say claim 'legitimacy' or say that the country has given them a mandate (as clearly the overwhelming majority of the public, in this example 80%, would not have done so).</p> <p>You watch any post-electoral TV discussion and see how much consternation there is over "low voter turnout" and "voter apathy" . Yet I guarantee you that you will not hear a single word about "spoiled ballots".</p> <p>Either vote, or don't vote, but spoiling ballots is a complete waste of time.</p> <p> </p> <p></p>

	<p><em><strong>Lou</strong> replies:</em> Thanks very much for this. I had seriously considered the spoiling option but hadn't considered that this also would validate the process because of the turnout figures. I shall stay at home instead.</p>

		<h2>About Not Apathetic</h2>
<p>NotApathetic was built so that people who are planning not to vote
in the <acronym title="United Kingdom">UK</acronym> General Election
on May 5th can tell the world why. We won't try to persuade you that
voting is a good or a bad idea - we're just here to record and share
your explanations. Whether ideological,	practical or other, any	reason
will do.</p>

<!--<p><a href="/cgi-bin/similarity.cgi">Help us spot patterns in
submitted reasons</a> (by telling us whether two posts are similar or
not)</p>-->

<small>A lot of users would like us to
mention that if you spoil your ballot paper, it <em>will</em>
be counted. So if you want to record a vote for "none of the
above", you can.</small>
