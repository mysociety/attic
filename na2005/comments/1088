	<p><em><strong>Tim Smith</strong> replies:</em> Did you ever consider that the 35% of the electorate who didn't vote at the last election might have been mistaken in thinking that there was no-one worth voting for?</p> <p>Just because several million people believe something, doesn't mean that what they believe must be true!</p> <p>If you don't vote, you deserve whatever government you get, and have no right to complain about it.  Enjoy the next five years of your life!<br /></p>

	<p><em><strong>Claire D</strong> replies:</em> But what if you do not want any of the parties on offer? And what if you do not agree with the voting system? The current election system is a bit like asking someone whether they would rather have a slap in the face or a poke in the eye. The choice of 'neither' is a valid choice.</p>

	<p><em><strong>Jack Matthew</strong> replies:</em> I have done quite a bit of canvassing in this campaign and i often hear people say that there is no one worth voting for. I ask these people what the policies of the three main parties are and I am allways met with a blank stare which seems to say 'well I don't no do I?'. We have newspapers, tv's, radios, the internet, the manifestos and the leaflets to find out what the parties stand for. If people can't even be bothered to look at these and at least find something to vote against then perhaps it's not such a bad thing that they are not voting.</p>

	<p><em><strong>ChrisC</strong> replies:</em> The argument that if you "don't vote, you deserve whatever government you get, and have no right to complain about it. " (Tim Smith) Is a childish dogatic sentiment given the current climate and diverse range of serious issues that aren't even discussed in the main stream media. The entire system needs serious reform, from the corporate media to the oxbridge elites, debating marginal management strategies for businesses to farm consumers. Largest war protest in history, unprecedented in that it was before the war, not during as with Vietnam. Quoting from judges at the Nuremberg trials, any unprovoked aggression "is not only an international crime, it is the supreme international crime [that] contains within itself the accumulated evil of the whole." </p>

		<h2>About Not Apathetic</h2>
<p>NotApathetic was built so that people who are planning not to vote
in the <acronym title="United Kingdom">UK</acronym> General Election
on May 5th can tell the world why. We won't try to persuade you that
voting is a good or a bad idea - we're just here to record and share
your explanations. Whether ideological,	practical or other, any	reason
will do.</p>

<!--<p><a href="/cgi-bin/similarity.cgi">Help us spot patterns in
submitted reasons</a> (by telling us whether two posts are similar or
not)</p>-->

<small>A lot of users would like us to
mention that if you spoil your ballot paper, it <em>will</em>
be counted. So if you want to record a vote for "none of the
above", you can.</small>
