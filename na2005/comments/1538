	<p><em><strong>HD</strong> replies:</em> Sorry for the long post but I am frightened by what I read here.  What is this obsession with immigration levels & supposed problem with a multicultural society?  I was born here, in West London, but my parents emigrated here back in the 1960's to work in the hospitals and do all the jobs no one else wanted to do.  (Similar to now I imagine)  They worked hard, started their own business, contributed to the economy, have NEVER claimed benefits in more than 40 years of their life here.  Are people truly saying they don't want people who work hard like this to come to this country and to try to make something from nothing?<br />Where does that leave me?  Am I English or am I 2nd generation immigrant?  Are the BNP & like minded parties talking about my parents?  Are they talking about me?  Should I go?  Where to?  I was born right here and have a rich cultural upbringing which is a mixture of my parents' culture, English culture and the culture of all my friends and their various nationalities - how can that possibly be wrong?  What have I lost because of this?  People come here because they see it as a country of opportunity like America - I don't think this is wrong and believe anyone willing to risk their life to try to get here ought to be given a chance to earn their stay.  It's a big deal - where would you risk your life to live a different life - can you even imagine the desperation in order to do that?  And would people really do that to live on a measly £30 or whatever it is a week off our DSS?  I am proud of Britain, I am proud of England and hope the next government takes us forwards to be leaders in areas of all fields - medical, educational, transport, environmental and cultural.  I love living here and I think it's the best place in the world.</p>

	<p><em><strong>A.S.</strong> replies:</em> Al- "The BNP as an institution is full of racists."</p> <p>What's your definition of a racist?</p> <p>"Their stand on immigration is "lets not have any"."</p> <p>This is a small island with finite space and already SE England is more densely populated than Holland or India.  More people means overcrowding, urban expansion, traffic congestion and a lot more pollution.  If this sounds good to you then don't vote BNP, just opt for a party with an open borders policy and we'll keep packing them in 50 to a house until there's no greenery left and the air turns black.</p> <p>"Their stand on employment is to give the best jobs to 'proper British people'. What they mean by 'proper British people' is white people, if your blonde with blue eyes your fine, despite originating from Scandinavia."</p> <p>Could you provide a link to prove the BNP's policy on only employing 'proper British people'?  I seem to have missed that one.</p> <p>Actually this is their stand on employment, it's in their manifesto if you've bothered to read it-</p> <p>[We would abolish all targets and quotas for ethnic representation in all areas of<br />employment, public and private.</p> <p>We would abolish all laws against racial discrimination in employment and the<br />government bodies associated with enforcing them.]</p> <p>Perhaps you favour anti-white discriminatory policies where employment is gained not on merit but on race?  As for the blue eyed blonde haired thing, you're just making it up aren't you Al?</p> <p>"Clearly this is not only a racist policy but also a totally bizarre policy, voting BNP is essentially like voting for the NAZI party."</p> <p>Clearly you're just coming to a conclusion about something you've just made up yourself and thrown in the word Nazi for dramatic effect.</p> <p>Why don't you download and read the BNP's manifesto and then we can discuss it.<br />http://www.bnp.org.uk/candidates2005/manifesto/manifesto2005.pdf</p> <p> </p>

	<p><em><strong>Gavin</strong> replies:</em> Immigration is a problem because immigrants are far too likely to humble, hard-working individuals who have gone to some lengths to better themselves (if only going to the effort to come here). This makes your average lazy Brit look bad.</p> <p>There are limits on space - the country feels pretty full to me, but most legal immigrants are a big plus for the country. We do need controls - it's only fair on immigrants; if there really aren't enough jobs going, you can't let people in with the promise of work. But the idea that we're being swamped is ridiculous.</p> <p>It would be good if integration was more universal, it seems a shame to come here and not be "British". That has nothing to do with skin colour, though, of course.</p> <p>The BNP do have a few ideas that are not completely stupid - but the very obvious racist undercurrents are disgusting. </p> <p>The Tory party have a completely different stance; there is nothing wrong with discussing this - it is an important issue. Whether it is as big a deal as some politicians are making out or not, people are concerned about it so it is worth discussing.</p>

	<p><em><strong>A.S.</strong> replies:</em> HD- The BNP plan to implement a system of VOLUNTARY repatriation for some legal immigrants currently residing in Britain.  The package includes a financial incentive in the order of tens of thousands of pounds and a free flight.  This would be very attractive to many people but ultimately if someone is a legal resident of the UK they will not be removed by force so don't worry.</p>

The one where the founder (I believe) criticises Michael Howard because "He's a Jew!"?</p> <p>All the parties cover up their real agendas with spin. So the BNP have cobbled together a non-racist manifesto - big deal. It doesn't tell the whole story.</p>

	<p><em><strong>Al</strong> replies:</em> Yes I have read it.</p> <p>http://www.bnp.org.uk/policies/policies.htm#immigration</p> <p>See the section called "ECONOMY - British workers first!"</p> <p>The public message they put out (including on this web site) is of course a toned down version of what you'll hear them say in places where their opinion is a safe one.</p> <p>My definition of a racist is a person that might say for example "I'm not a racist but their's alot of those bloody packies round here isn't there? You can't move for them!".</p> <p>If your not a racist it's not an issue that theirs lots of "Pakies" in your area and neither would you refer to them in a disrespectful way such as to call them a Pakie.</p> <p>Another definition is someone that dislikes a person on the basis of colour.</p> <p>It's ok to dislike people on the basis of their opinions though, and that why it's fine for me to dislike you or indeed to consider you to be a wanker. This is acceptable as it's based on my judgement of your views without knowing the colour of your skin and on the basis of the plain fact that you ARE a wanker.</p> <p>Am I allowed to say wanker?...</p> <p>I retract my wanker statement. </p>

	<p><em><strong>A.S.</strong> replies:</em> Gavin - "Immigration is a problem because immigrants are far too likely to humble, hard-working individuals who have gone to some lengths to better themselves (if only going to the effort to come here). This makes your average lazy Brit look bad."</p> <p>Immigration is a problem because immigrants are far too likely to not find work and end up taking advantage of Britain's welfare state, free schooling, healthcare and  housing.  Most immigrants to these shores come from very alien countries and cultures and do not adjust well to life in Britain, choosing instead to form ghettos in which cultural assimilation or even just learning English  is easily avoidable.  Many bring with them the problems they were fleeing in their homeland, through religious beliefs and acquired cultural values incompatible with those in the West.</p> <p>Britain did very well for centuries without the need to bring in utterly alien peoples from across the globe with whom we  have so little in common.</p>

	<p><em><strong>A.S.</strong> replies:</em> Mr Moore, HD, Gavin-</p> <p>Thank you for discussing these matters with me in a reasonably civil manner.  After the written abuse I have now suffered from both Jim and especially Al I have decided to not post in this forum.  If anyone is interested in further discussing these issues please go to-</p> <p>http://www.<br />stormfront.org/forum/ind...referrerid=45010</p> <p>You don't have to register to post, please start a new thread with the title "notapethetic" and we can have more advanced bulletin software and proper moderation where troublemakers like Al will be booted off.</p> <p>People like Al are the reason why public debate about immigration and such does not exist, why the militant fascist left assault peaceful protesters and campaign for legitimate political parties to be unlawfully silenced.  He represents the beginning of the end for democracy and free speech in our country. </p>

	<p><em><strong>raymond</strong> replies:</em> A.S.: Yes immigration may be a percieved problem and there is nothing wrong about discussing it. But it needs to be discussed in an honest way. What do you think is the percentage of immigrants on unemployement benefits? 23 out of 150,000 who came in last year. Would you say that about your party members?  Let us face it: no body in their right mind would come to country where anti-immigrant feeling is so high for just 30 or 40 pounds a weeks. That is an absolute poverty level. They want to become rich and not poor. They want to give better education to their children - not involved them in drugs/alchohol/gangs.</p> <p>Yes: space is limited - so immigration needs to be controlled. Controlled not by colour of skin or religion but by the need of the country. BNP will force to shut all the NHS hospitals - over 50% NHS staff is immigrant. NHS is not actively recruiting outside UK, speially India. Why? or you don't want to know.</p> <p>London buses have more immigrant drivers now than ever. Why? Where are those proper Brits? Perhaps on dole, having lager all day and talking about immigration and race riots.</p> <p>Believe me, if you think honestly - you will start to why immigrants are here in the first place. Because we need them. </p> <p></p>

	<p><em><strong>Tom</strong> replies:</em> Honestly i'm not am a very political person but the fact is, everybody is entitled to their own views, some of you may believe that BNP are left wing and some of you may believe otherwise. I believe that there should be tighter laws on immigration. However this is only to stop people coming into the country who bring nothing with them (i.e. qualifications) My opinion is that anybody who has a good reason to come to the country should be allowed in, a good reason though is not, a better quality of life, people can find that in any other country. Why does Britain have to rehouse people from the rest of the world. I do not believe in judging people by the colour of their skin simply because some of my closest friends are black and asian. Everybody should be entitled to their own views, but clearly Al is trying to label the BNP as racist when in fact it is labeling people that he is so against.</p>

It's common knowlege that the BNP is supported mostly by racists and many of it's candidates hold racist views. MANY not nessisarily ALL but enough to effect the parties policy and to steer it in the wrong direction.</p>

	<p><em><strong>WM</strong> replies:</em> BNP may arouse  fear, with under-currents of racism. We don't have to look too far back in our history for the  consequences of apathy.</p> <p>Either way though, what is wrong with putting the rights of Britains before EVERYBODY else. Legal immigrants fine e.g immigrants plugging the emplyment gaps in the health service etc (which we should really ask why this should happen; another matter). Its about balancing contributions and perceived returns.</p> <p>If immigrants work and contribute, I have no problem with them receiving benefits (which I don't think they are entitled to ). Its about a perception of value for money. It sickens me to support British lazy arses, and it sickens me more to pay for the housing and administration of bogus  Asylum seekers when I think they should not be our problem.</p> <p>My priorities are "my family", "my siblings families", "my friends and their families", "prosperity of local region", "prosperity of nation". Outside of these groups and this nations borders I don't wanty a single penny of my tax used.</p> <p>That is not racists.It may be selfish, but if I dont put the things which matter to me first, why should I expect anyone else to ?</p>

	<p><em><strong>John</strong> replies:</em> We are hearing the same of criticisms of the BNP, time and time again. The media is hysterical in its treatment of the BNP and so are most people who read and listen to the garbage which they are force-fed. Multiculturalism is not an ideal solution for any of us, but we usually manage with what we have got, and when we do not the consequences are sometimes tragic.  Why is it racist to acknowledge this? Immigration mainly benefits the globalists and this  is why the globalists are so anti-BNP. Britain is actually full. There is no more room  and we need the BNP to save our country and hopefully create a resurgence in nationalism worldwide.</p> <p>The old imperialism was colonialism, and the new imperialism is globalism and antinationalism. Why are nations not allowed to have the right to national self-determination? Why shouldn't nations define themselves on grounds of shared ethnicity?

	<p><em><strong>Al</strong> replies:</em> Don't oppose the above too posts general idea that we should look after ourselves before anyone else but their is no media conspiracy against the BNP, the majority of the media (excluding the tabloids - I don't consider these 'news' paper anyway)  are just doing their job and reporting the facts as they see them.</p> <p>I would accept that many people in the BNP have the same reasonable, understandable views as yourselves but the fact is that their is a racist element that drives the party.</p> <p>Although I accept and understand your views, I don't agree with your aproach to dealing with the issue.  We need to restrict the number of people coming into the country, the country isn't 'full'.</p>

	<p><em><strong>WM</strong> replies:</em> I read all 54 pages of the BNP manifesto. Some bits made me nod in agreement (crime, back-to-basics education, preservation of language/customs and identity) other bits frigthened me (repatriation of immigrants). There is something in the shadows that doesn't sit right with me concerning the BNP, so no vote from me...</p> <p> Don't mistake this for someone whole doesn't firmly believes in a British identity and a more self-centered approach to policy.<br />Probably UKIP will be getting my cross.  A protest vote, yes, but the" big three" seem to live in a different world to myself, too scared to upset the apple-cart or risk being too different</p> <p>It is sickeningly obvious that this whole campaign has been focused on the minority of marginal votes. A blinkered, lightweight campaign with nothing original or thought-provoking. Sometimes democracy sucks......</p>

	<p><em><strong>jerry</strong> replies:</em> Anyone who's actually witnessed the Foreign and Home Offices processing transparently genuine applications for visas, FLR, ILR and naturalisation, wouldn't say that there's anything easy about migrating to UK. </p> <p>The Budd report described ridiculously inefficient systems at IND, that inconvenience bona fide applicants, while less desirable characters sneak through in a tangle of red tape. Let's sort this mess out before we start issuing machine guns to border guards.</p>

	<p><em><strong>raymond</strong> replies:</em> I feel that a broad consensus is emerging that immigration should be based on the needs of the country. If we need health workers/bus drivers/IT specialist, then thats what our immigration policy should get us.</p> <p>Secondly, as a civilized country, we have obligation to GENUINE Refugees; but also rest of the world should do its part. I agree that we cannot re-house rest of the world here.</p> <p>Thirdly, with respect to refugees, i tend to agree with the Australian model. Those claiming asylum should be detained until their genuineness is proven. If genuine, welcome them. if not, thank you - they go back. </p> <p>Forth, any body with open mind could see what BNP is. BBC investigation recently  resulted in criminal charges against its leaders and members. Please don't insult our intelligence and test our memories. Go on the street anywhere in Yorkshire, ask any true blood Brit and they will tell you exactly what BNP is. For Pete's sake, media is not after them. It's BNP which needs to understand present day world and its morals. Otherwise, we should not have bothered about Iraq. </p>

	<p><em><strong>Barry</strong> replies:</em> Raymond you need to understand that the so-called 'expose' of the BNP done by the Blatant Bias Corporation was a set-up from start to finish. The fact is that so-called documentary used Left-wing agent provocateurs and agents from the Marxist and anti-British Searchlight organisation run by the convicted burglar and former Communist Party candidate Gerry Gable. In short, it was a pack of lies and the typical Left-wing bias the pathetic BBC produces!</p>

	<p><em><strong>Rhia</strong> replies:</em> The BNP does offer some sense in it's policies, but it is undoubtedly a racist organisation at core, and furthermore over the course of time many of it's own leading members have made statements both comparative to and in agreement with policies of the Nazi party relating to ethnic backgrounds. One such member.</p> <p>In fact, a previous leader of the BNP, John Tyndal, said (and I quote) "Mein Kampf is my bible.". This same person was: Imprisoned in October 1962 for training a Nazi paramilitary group!</p> <p>Richard Edmonds, (a former? )BNP national activities organiser remarking on the BNP: We are 100 percent racist, yes. (20 February 1993, the Guardian)</p> <p>Tony Lecomber, prominent in the BNP hierarchy, served three years in jail for a nail bomb plot. He got another three years in 1991 for stabbing a Jewish teacher and has 12 convictions in all.</p> <p>To me it sounds like underneath the surface, this is quite a nasty organisation. I have no problem with nasty organisations, nor with people who support them knowing that they are nasty (though I do tend to take an instant dislike to such people and organisations). Though, in all fairness, lets call a spade a spade here.</p>

	<p><em><strong>Sebastian</strong> replies:</em> "I've more respect for someone who come's out and says, "I'm racist", rather than holding racist views but claiming not to be a racist."</p> <p>Of course, to someone like you, a racist is any white person who wants to preserve his country. You don't even realize that leftist sages like yourself have completely invalidated the word "racist" altogether. It's a joke when you use it, like a child trying to sling mud 'cause his brain has not yet developed sufficiently for him to use it instead of his hand.</p> <p>Same old boring story from the herd.</p>

	<p><em><strong>Al</strong> replies:</em> <br />According to you I think " a racist is any white person who wants to preserve his country"</p> <p>No sweet heart.</p> <p>That would depend on your definition of preserving your country, and the way you'd go about it.</p> <p>I'm against political correctness.</p> <p>We can't say "there is a disproportionate number of crimes being commited by young black people in London" whether or not this is a fact.</p> <p>And so we couldn't even begin to look at resolving that sort of problem because we're not even permitted to accept it's existence.</p> <p>If this was a genuine problem and we were to accept it, it wouldn't mean that we should kick out all black people, it would mean that we should look at the reasons why these people are turning to crime.</p> <p>I'm against the BNP because many of their supporters don't like black people or asians just because they are black or asian and don't want them in our country because of this.</p> <p>I've said I wouldn't waste my time arguing with time waster BNP supporters. Wrong again.</p>
