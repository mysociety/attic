	<dd><p>Write your reasons here...<br />We often hear that people died for our right to vote, an argument that I would agree with totally.  However, i believe that the people who died would be disgusted with the version of democarcy we that has evolved, with very little difference between the major parties, the loss of vision and ideals, with a transfer of real power to corporations and the media.  I feel that they too would not vote - as a signal of defiance.  Anty thoughts?</p>

	<p><em><strong>dcd</strong> replies:</em> I agree, and I would add that it is a shame that there seems to be nobody willing to continue their work for a better representational system, nobody willing to die for that cause any more.</p> <p>Without people like that, it would seem like we're stuck with what we've got.</p> <p>But yes, there IS another way... silence, non-participation -- not voting.</p> <p>If we do not play their little game, they have no mandate, the system would become invalid as representing the people, and we would officially fail to be a democracy unless we did some serious changing.</p> <p>Not voting seems to be THE ONLY VIABLE solution.</p>

	<p><em><strong>Max</strong> replies:</em> The tragedy is that the "right" to vote was not accompanied by a desire to build a better world, just the opportunity to vote for a continuation of the old exploitative capitalist system. Don't blame the politicians for the voters, the former are just a reflection of the latter, just giving the majority what they want.</p>

		<h2>About Not Apathetic</h2>
<p>NotApathetic was built so that people who are planning not to vote
in the <acronym title="United Kingdom">UK</acronym> General Election
on May 5th can tell the world why. We won't try to persuade you that
voting is a good or a bad idea - we're just here to record and share
your explanations. Whether ideological,	practical or other, any	reason
will do.</p>

<!--<p><a href="/cgi-bin/similarity.cgi">Help us spot patterns in
submitted reasons</a> (by telling us whether two posts are similar or
not)</p>-->

<small>A lot of users would like us to
mention that if you spoil your ballot paper, it <em>will</em>
be counted. So if you want to record a vote for "none of the
above", you can.</small>
