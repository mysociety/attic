	<p><em><strong>Kathleen</strong> replies:</em>  I agree with Max.</p> <p>I also think that it would have been better for you to take the step of becoming informed.</p> <p>However, I do think it's better not to vote just for the sake of it. As you say - it would be irresponsible and could do more harm than good (<a>assuming your vote would have counted</a>, which is another matter altogether).</p> <p>Of course, it may be that that you could do more good than harm by voting randomly, but that would still be irresponsible.</p> <p>I advise you to do some research next time... :)</p>

	<p><em><strong>Dan</strong> replies:</em> I didn't vote because I no longer believe people are too ignorant to vote sensibly while all the parties are wallowing in diversion and mediocraty. Party pledges created using market research computer programs contain no real innovation or appeal for me. While realistically implememting world ideals would spell poverty at home, Labour are afraid to deliver my dreams through fear of loosing to the Tories. The Tories on the other hand walk defiantly down the neo-conservative road delivering their Power of Nightmares. Bollocks to it !!</p>

	<p><em><strong>Anonymous</strong> replies:</em> I'm not excusing my lack of knowledge, and like I said, if I were to play a responsible and valuable part in the democratic process I would have made an effort to become better informed. Part of my point is that I think many people who vote are no better informed than me. They seem to make their choices based on sound bites and spin. The parties are in a large part to blame. I don't see the point. Also I am not opting out altogether. I feel I can make a difference in other, more direct ways. I work tirelessly for a charity that I believe passionately in. I doesn't address all the issues that are important to me, but at least I can see the difference it makes for real people every day. Casting a vote once every few years won't do that for me.</p>

	<p><em><strong>Max</strong> replies:</em> You may think that working for a charity is something worthy, and your motives probably are. But in effect charities are in existence to help the rich, so that they don't have to contribute too much they redirect the collecting bowl to the working class, the poorest section of the community.<br />Bob Geldof is in favour of "fair" capitalism because he is doing well by it and doesn't want to give up too much of his wealth to help the starving. In fact, he and others in his position who support capitalism are themselves responsible for the starvation that exists throughout the world.</p>

		<h2>About Not Apathetic</h2>
<p>NotApathetic was built so that people who are planning not to vote
in the <acronym title="United Kingdom">UK</acronym> General Election
on May 5th can tell the world why. We won't try to persuade you that
voting is a good or a bad idea - we're just here to record and share
your explanations. Whether ideological,	practical or other, any	reason
will do.</p>

<!--<p><a href="/cgi-bin/similarity.cgi">Help us spot patterns in
submitted reasons</a> (by telling us whether two posts are similar or
not)</p>-->

<small>A lot of users would like us to
mention that if you spoil your ballot paper, it <em>will</em>
be counted. So if you want to record a vote for "none of the
above", you can.</small>
