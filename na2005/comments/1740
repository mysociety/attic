	<dd><p>Because I withold my consent from being governed.</p> <p>Voting only encourages them. I find it insulting that they believe millions will not vote simply because they don't care, or worse still they are happy. </p> <p>Government spends 40% of our money and sets legislation pretty much as it sees fit. One vote in 40 million, once every 4 years is no sort of democratic mandate for this level of power.</p> <p>As for saying that those who don't vote have no right to complain - Rubbish! The pretence of legitimate governance is maintained by the facade of a popular mandate. If the turn out was 40% the distribution of votes would be entirely irrelevant. The resulting government would have to, as it's primary focus, re-evaluate the relationship between individual and state. This is LONG overdue!<br /></p>

	<p><em><strong>Rob Byatt</strong> replies:</em> Surly you realise though that if you vote, your voice is heard much loader than if your just apathetic. If you vote the government can't file you away as lazy or politically challenged instead you give your voice and the power it holds to another party that as a result will grow stronger and even if they are never elected give your views much more voice than if you were just to do nothing and protest by not voting, as it seems you are doing now. I would just also point out that voting isn't always giving your consent to be governed it can be more about having your say in the way the country is run (even if that would be with out a government) and how your 40% tax is spent.</p> <p>I must urge anyone who reads this too vote, I agree that this government is rubbish and we are unlikely to get anything new. But voting is so much more effective in making a change than apathy is, let the people run this country not one person in 10 downing street</p>

	<p><em><strong>Alex</strong> replies:</em> Thing is Rob I just don't even share a frame of reference with these parties.</p> <p>I can pick out maybe 2 or 3 instances in the last year where a politician has said something I agree with in principal. Other times it's sort of like asking me who I want to win a fight in a pub. I don't care, just keep it away from me!</p>

		<h2>About Not Apathetic</h2>
<p>NotApathetic was built so that people who are planning not to vote
in the <acronym title="United Kingdom">UK</acronym> General Election
on May 5th can tell the world why. We won't try to persuade you that
voting is a good or a bad idea - we're just here to record and share
your explanations. Whether ideological,	practical or other, any	reason
will do.</p>

<!--<p><a href="/cgi-bin/similarity.cgi">Help us spot patterns in
submitted reasons</a> (by telling us whether two posts are similar or
not)</p>-->

<small>A lot of users would like us to
mention that if you spoil your ballot paper, it <em>will</em>
be counted. So if you want to record a vote for "none of the
above", you can.</small>
