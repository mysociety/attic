I don't believe in one person, or a select few, having the power (literally of life and death sometimes) over anyone/everyone else.  To me Democracy means more than a cross in a box every four years next to the name of a party which conflicts least with your moral standards.  I don't vote not because i think my vote wont make a difference, but because i know it wont.</p>

	<p><em><strong>John Dryden</strong> replies:</em> I can't agree more. At the end of the day Toni Blair and Maggie Thatcher have exactly the same ideas, which boils down to enslaving the people and extending the wealth of the upper classs.</p>

	<p><em><strong>Jubal Harshaw</strong> replies:</em> Quite. Though,  I feel that the problem that you have identified is not just attributable to certain individuals. <br />The issue, as I see it, is that the very political process itself creates people who are devoid of any will to change things for the better.<br />It goes something like this:</p> <p>Person joins party of their choice.<br />Decides to run for election to change things for the better. <br />Suddenly, has to choose between voicing concern of electorate and abiding by the party line in order to progress far enough in the party to have the power to change things. <br />The further you progress in the party, the more important following the system is and the more irrelevant the electorate becomes until, finally, you have no interest in them whatsoever and only wish to preserve or better your current status. </p> <p>It happens in every heirarchical system. The genius of this one is that it ensares people with the false hope of being able to change things and, by believing this, it robs them of the will to do it. </p> <p>The problems that we face today, be it corporate, political, religious or whatever stem from the fact that we are surrounded by generations-old systems that are specifically designed to perpetuate themselves, using us - often unwittingly.</p>

		<h2>About Not Apathetic</h2>
<p>NotApathetic was built so that people who are planning not to vote
in the <acronym title="United Kingdom">UK</acronym> General Election
on May 5th can tell the world why. We won't try to persuade you that
voting is a good or a bad idea - we're just here to record and share
your explanations. Whether ideological,	practical or other, any	reason
will do.</p>

<!--<p><a href="/cgi-bin/similarity.cgi">Help us spot patterns in
submitted reasons</a> (by telling us whether two posts are similar or
not)</p>-->

<small>A lot of users would like us to
mention that if you spoil your ballot paper, it <em>will</em>
be counted. So if you want to record a vote for "none of the
above", you can.</small>
