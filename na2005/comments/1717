	<dd><p>SPOIL YOUR VOTE - I refuse to vote Labour this time mainly due to the war and Blair, but I did not want to be dismissed as 'apathetic' by politicians who do not want to face up to the real reasons why people do not vote. I spoilt my vote: at least then it will be counted. If everyone on this site did the same, maybe we would be noticed. <br />I live in France, where it seems that 'ordinary' people care about and discuss politics. I just spent five days in London, and walking about residential areas saw barely any Vote... posters in windows. I remember elections in the 80s and 90s; posters were everywhere, you could not get away from the fact that there was an imminent election. Where has the engagement gone? </p>

	<p><em><strong>Boojam</strong> replies:</em> As the name of this site implies, there are very many people out there who do "care about and discuss politics" - but don't feel they support any one party and so don't have posters in their windows. As you have posted on this site, I presume you don't have any posters in your windows either. So aren't you being a bit hypocritical?</p> <p>The down-side of Gallic political passion is that they have strong loony left and loony right parties, which I'm pretty glad we don't have in this country.</p>

	<p><em><strong>eleanor</strong> replies:</em> Reply to Boojam: Yes OK that is hypocritical of me - I was just shocked that walking around London one could hardly tell that there was going to be an election in a few days.  I grew up in the 80s and 90s and was out delivering Labour leaflets and posters with my Dad, and there were posters in almost every window. It is a strong indictment of the current government that many of the same people no longer wish to do that. <br />I suggest that next election we create a 'not apathetic' poster for anyone that wants to show their discontent in their front window!</p>

		<h2>About Not Apathetic</h2>
<p>NotApathetic was built so that people who are planning not to vote
in the <acronym title="United Kingdom">UK</acronym> General Election
on May 5th can tell the world why. We won't try to persuade you that
voting is a good or a bad idea - we're just here to record and share
your explanations. Whether ideological,	practical or other, any	reason
will do.</p>

<!--<p><a href="/cgi-bin/similarity.cgi">Help us spot patterns in
submitted reasons</a> (by telling us whether two posts are similar or
not)</p>-->

<small>A lot of users would like us to
mention that if you spoil your ballot paper, it <em>will</em>
be counted. So if you want to record a vote for "none of the
above", you can.</small>
