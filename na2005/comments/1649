	<dd><p>I have become increasingly disillusioned with the political system. All Politicians, irrespective of  which party they represent spew forth an endless flood of spin, lies and opportunistic  insults to try and gain cheap point with the electorate. <br />I find that I cannot agree with any political party on the majority of their policies. Labour have proven themselves to be a party of spin, propaganda and secrecy, the very things they promised they would not be. The Tories base their whole campaign on opportunistic bandwagon jumping and their ability to function as a competent government seems doubtful. I disagree with Lib Dem policy on almost every level.<br />But the major reason for my Apathy is the apparent disdain shown by politicians towards the public. They hold them selves above and do not recognise themselves as representing or being accountable to the public. Their job is to serve the needs of the people, not tell us what we need/want.  If politicians treated us with more respect and held themselves accountable for decisions I may be more inclined to vote. As it is I hope my, and others decision to not participate will show how disillusioned a great deal of the population is with the system and politics.<br /> </p>

	<p><em><strong>nico</strong> replies:</em> Actually telling us what we need/want is precisely their job. You vote for someone to represent you - not to do what you say. They may have to act against your wishes in the knowledge that its better for the country or their constituency. you choose a leader every 5 years that dosent mean you agree with everything they do but it gives them the freedom to follow their own judgement, not blindly follow the fickle wishes of their constituents. if you feel your MP NEVER acts in your interests - get another one.</p>

		<h2>About Not Apathetic</h2>
<p>NotApathetic was built so that people who are planning not to vote
in the <acronym title="United Kingdom">UK</acronym> General Election
on May 5th can tell the world why. We won't try to persuade you that
voting is a good or a bad idea - we're just here to record and share
your explanations. Whether ideological,	practical or other, any	reason
will do.</p>

<!--<p><a href="/cgi-bin/similarity.cgi">Help us spot patterns in
submitted reasons</a> (by telling us whether two posts are similar or
not)</p>-->

<small>A lot of users would like us to
mention that if you spoil your ballot paper, it <em>will</em>
be counted. So if you want to record a vote for "none of the
above", you can.</small>
