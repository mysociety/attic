	<p><em><strong>RogerCO</strong> replies:</em> A vote for a 'minor' party is NOT a wasted vote.<br />If you don't vote for what you believe in then you will never get it.<br />Every Green vote pushes the sustainability and environmental issues up the political agenda - even if they fail to get a single MP under 1st past the post they already have MEPs, MSPs, GLA and local councillors and every vote strengthens them.<br />Greens have a truely radical and progressive set of policies and are the only party taking real issues seriously (why do you think petrol is now over 90p/litre?)<br />If you have a local Green standing then support them - if you have Respect standing then that would be a 'respectable' protest vote against new labour also.<br /></p>

	<p><em><strong>Radio</strong> replies:</em> Why would you 'hold your nose and vote labour' if you're not happy with them ?<br />Surely <strong>That</strong> would be a wasted vote.</p> <p>Voting for a minor party is <strong>not</strong> a wasted vote if its what you beleive in and it helps the party grow.</p> <p>How are any other parties supposed to gain strenght to challenge the established parties if people don't vote for them on the basis of 'oh well i'd like to see such and such win but they're not going to so I wont vote for them'<br />Its a stupid way of thinking.</p> <p>Radio</p>

	<p><em><strong>Al</strong> replies:</em> If enough people "throw away" their vote on a "minor" party, that party then ceases to be a minor party, so the vote isn't wasted. If you still don't want to vote for a minor party, spoil your paper, at least it shows you've thought about it, and it registers a protest. <br />If you feel strongly that you would have to hold your nose to vote labour, you obviously shouldn't vote for them, as that would be a thrown away vote.</p>

		<h2>About Not Apathetic</h2>
<p>NotApathetic was built so that people who are planning not to vote
in the <acronym title="United Kingdom">UK</acronym> General Election
on May 5th can tell the world why. We won't try to persuade you that
voting is a good or a bad idea - we're just here to record and share
your explanations. Whether ideological,	practical or other, any	reason
will do.</p>

<!--<p><a href="/cgi-bin/similarity.cgi">Help us spot patterns in
submitted reasons</a> (by telling us whether two posts are similar or
not)</p>-->

<small>A lot of users would like us to
mention that if you spoil your ballot paper, it <em>will</em>
be counted. So if you want to record a vote for "none of the
above", you can.</small>
