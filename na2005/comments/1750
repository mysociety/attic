	<p><em><strong>Rob</strong> replies:</em> Well its good to see that this debate has not been reduced to name calling and hair pulling.  I may not agree with the policies of the BNP but I will defend with my life their right to voice them.  Freedom of speach is the very basis of democracy and for us to stiffle their views is the give validity to them.  It is unfortunate that the BNP has any following at all in modern society however that perhaps is fault of society itself.  Personally I regret that the BNP are not standing in my constituency as not voting for them would give me great satisfaction.</p>

	<p><em><strong>Lee S</strong> replies:</em> <br />No Tiger, I've done my time now, I've been re-educated and placed back in society, I'm not going back there.</p> <p>Yes, quite right honourable Barry, I can't stress enough just how communist and leftie all these leftie communists that don't like the BNP are, they're just so leftie and communist. We should make a point of stressing the communist nature of these lefties more often... if at all possible. They have no valid point as you say, they simply call us racists and fascists, and this is no argument.</p> <p>So I want this country to give preferential treatment to indigenous white British people in the job market, does this make me a racist?</p> <p>So I don't want my country to be swamped with blacks and Asians and those horrible men that dress up like girls, does this make me fascist?</p> <p>It's just indicative of the politically correct, leftie communist country that Britain is becoming.</p> <p>And another thing, I'm sick of hearing the same old jokes about the BNP "That BNP candidate George Galloway did well in Barking didn't he, it'd have to be in Barking wouldn't it" it sickens me!<br /></p>

	<p><em><strong>Al</strong> replies:</em> Barry & Lee;</p> <p>Quite right, argument lost, I apologise, the BNP aren't a bunch of racists, they're a set of lovely people with only the best interest of this country at heart.</p> <p>OK, true Nick Griffin the BNP pary leader did use BNP funds to add an extension to his house, but that doesn't mean he's not an honest chap, how can you run an empire like his with only four bedrooms?  And those convictions for inciting racial hatred, well that was completely misinterpreted, they thought he'd said "I don't want any of those blacks and jews in my country" what he actually said was "I don't want any of that <em>blackcurrant juice</em> in my country" refering to his aversion to blackcurrant juice. </p> <p>By the way, well done on your resounding success in this years generally election... particularly Barking.</p>

	<p><em><strong>Rich B</strong> replies:</em> Write your response...<br />Keep britain for the british.  Too right.  First though, you should prove the purity of our 'race' through blood lines.  If you can catergorically prove that you don't have any johnny foreigner in you from way back, fair enough.  That includes any Celt, Roman, Viking, Saxon  - all imports.  Civilisation started in Syria - should we allow them in or not?</p> <p>We are a mongrel race - accept it.  The racial purity argument doesn't hold up for us, sorry.</p>

	<p><em><strong>Rich B</strong> replies:</em> Write your response...<br />If the BNP stood in the majority of places, people would rush to vote against them - look at Le Pen in France.  Even left wingers came out backing the more moderate, largely disliked, right wing candidate in Chirac!</p> <p>Would we all come out and vote to stall the BNP and Fascism?  Perhaps the BNP could invigorate the disenfranchised!  Nick Griffin - the saviour of democracy?</p>

	<p><em><strong>TinyTim</strong> replies:</em> I found this which is quite interesting, Join the BNP, we are winning!</p> <p>It is within all true patriots hearts that even if is was to be positively and undeniably confirmed with irrefutable evidence and put to them in a clear and understandable way so that no doubt could be possible that all their efforts are in vein and their downfall inevitable, that they would still carry the flag forward and the fight on. It would be so that all their might would be doubled, their determination more fervent and the flow of victory running through their veins and through their hearts even stronger and prouder! This is the way it is for a true patriot, for it is his will and nature to be true to himself, his country and his people, regardless of neither the consequences nor the outcome. - Michael E.L. Rogers, Britain Under Seige.</p>
