	<p><em><strong>Ben</strong> replies:</em> Democracy sucks?? What a load of rubbish. Why don't you think for a moment what it would be like living under a brutal totalitarian regime with no prospect for change. Bet democracy is looking pretty damn good to you now. Wake up and smell the flowers mate.</p>

	<p><em><strong>stereoroid</strong> replies:</em> That's a little short-sighted; it's the influence of the media that gets idiots with good hair elected. </p> <p>The media influence is nothing new, but it has only been all-important since the Nixon/Kennedy debates of 1960. Kennedy looked better on TV and took the job that year, but Nixon learned his lesson and used it to good effect 8 years later. </p> <p>Can you imagine wanting to be a politician? I can't. To have that desire for power an control makes a politician the wrong person to have any power at all - so we don't vote for them!  8-) </p>

	<p><em><strong>Matt</strong> replies:</em> A very good arguement could be made for having some sort of technocratic body running the country. You could have older, experienced people from business, politics etc having some sort of say on how laws are made etc. Older, more experienced people would be more likely to resist rapid, impulsive change, and be less likely to bow to the whim of the media. (Dangerous dogs act anyone? Gun control? Immigration crackdown?)</p> <p>Possibly combining it with an elected government who has to win a majority of the votes in the election, and have elections every few years.</p> <p>Isn't that the system we're supposed to have now?</p>

		<h2>About Not Apathetic</h2>
<p>NotApathetic was built so that people who are planning not to vote
in the <acronym title="United Kingdom">UK</acronym> General Election
on May 5th can tell the world why. We won't try to persuade you that
voting is a good or a bad idea - we're just here to record and share
your explanations. Whether ideological,	practical or other, any	reason
will do.</p>

<!--<p><a href="/cgi-bin/similarity.cgi">Help us spot patterns in
submitted reasons</a> (by telling us whether two posts are similar or
not)</p>-->

<small>A lot of users would like us to
mention that if you spoil your ballot paper, it <em>will</em>
be counted. So if you want to record a vote for "none of the
above", you can.</small>
