	<p><em><strong>WM</strong> replies:</em> That response from Helen is infantile and lacking in substance, wholly rude and generally crass...</p> <p>Last post from me on these boards, I think. I find it highly distressing that people find it impossible to maintain even a modicum of respect for others, inspite of their disagreement, for their equally valid views. Maybe thats just politics for you.</p> <p>As sad reflection on the state of this country and the world....<br />I'm not BNP, not even close but I try to remain civil and use founded, balanced arguements to  discuss these most important issues. Its easy to remain civil amongst peers, but quality shows from remaining civil when opposed.</p> <p>Millions have died for us to have these democratic rights and discussions without fear. Its a disgrace  how flippant some commentators  are across all these threads.</p> <p>You have every right to disagree, but no right to insult.  I leave the rest of these discussions  up to you..</p>

	<p><em><strong>Al</strong> replies:</em> <br />The BNP aren't a serious party, it's pointless going into the rights and wrongs of their policies or the views of it supporters because they're just never going to get in.</p> <p>I've wasted too much of my time trying to reason with BNP suporters. It's like talking to a brick wall... although I'm being a little harsh on the intellegence of brick walls.</p>

	<p><em><strong>.</strong> replies:</em> I am in total agreement with the post from WM.... but I would suggest that AL is quite wrong in saying that this party is not serious, it appears that they are and becoming more serious as time goes on. they are in fact the main alternative to the con/lab/lib establishment con.I'm afraid that people deserve a voice, whether you like it or not and if the main establishment parties cant/wont speak up for a large section of society then others will.<br />as for "reasoning with their supporters"......it sounds as if your the one who isn't listening...their view is just as valid as yours. brick walls and intelligence.... well maybe we should be looking at the masses that still buy into the political system we have at the moment.</p>

	<p><em><strong>Al</strong> replies:</em> In response I'll repeat my comments from a previous post....</p> <p>To put it simply the BNP are racist, Nazi supporting thugs and criminals.</p> <p>I haven't time to list all of the criminals who are part of the BNP but I'll name some keys ones. Bear in mind that this is a relatively small party!</p> <p>Nick Griffin (Party Chairman)- Convicted for inciting racial hate (amonst many many many other convictions - not nessisarily race related). He also denied the holocaust happened, f*cking idiot.</p> <p>John Tyndall (inventor of the BNP)- Has a list of convictions as long as your arm including setting up a paramilitary organisation - because they're always good for britain aren't they? He was also inprisoned for incitment to racial hatred.</p> <p>Warren Bennett (chief steward)- Convicted for football hooliganism.</p> <p>So, these people are going to help REDUCE crime ? They aren't doing a very good job at the moment.</p>

	<p><em><strong>.</strong> replies:</em> your view is respected but far too simplistic....it is easy to use labels and generalisations...do you not see that if a large part of society especially in the light of all of the negative propaganda put out by the establishment are still being drawn to this party then the problem IS with the establishment. the people who vote for them aren't all goose stepping monsters as you imply, but normal people with a viewpoint that should be heard. as for criminals......sending British soldiers to their deaths under false pretences to further hidden political agendas,is, I am sure you will agree  a far worse crime than being a football hooligan.  </p>

	<p><em><strong>Al</strong> replies:</em> <br />I've seen posts from very reasonable people that are also BNP supporters.  They have valid points to make and understandable concerns and they see the BNP as the party that's going to address those concerns. </p> <p>The trouble is that the BNP is pandering to these type of votes, that's all people like Nick Griffin do. They have a public opinion which they try to match up to their target  voter and then they have the core values of the party which are something competley different and somewhat disturbing.</p> <p>Basically they're doing exactly what Labour and the Conservatives do.</p>

	<p><em><strong>Pete</strong> replies:</em> Its always interesting to read some of the comments of so-called BNP supporters, more so when their comments dont agree with what the BNP actually believes in or what its leaders actually have said.</p> <p>The quote of: <em>sending British soldiers to their deaths under false pretences to further hidden political agendas</em>.</p> <p>In fact the BNP was fully supportive towards the invasion of Iraq. What they were against was Tony Blair trying to gain political capital out of it, in much the same way as Margaret Thatcher was accused of milking the Falklands War in order to gain re-election.</p> <p>And just so that the opening poster is aware, Britain for the British is NOT a BNP belief and never has been. </p> <p>The BNP believes in the assisted repatriation of all non-whites, regardless of Nationality. </p> <p>Perhaps the original poster is confusing the BNP with the National Front, which held similar views to the BNP, but which actually did base many of its policies along British Only lines. FYI, that was one of the fundamental differences between the two parties.</p> <p>Therefore BRITAIN for the WHITE people only is perhaps a better description to use as white Germans, French, Dutch, South Africans, etc and anyone else who doesn't have any history (over the last 2 generations)of black or Asiatic genes in their family would be allowed to stay in the UK.<br /></p>

	<p><em><strong>jax</strong> replies:</em> There is corruption everywhere you look within most political parties - the difference is that in MOST cases (im not as green as i am cabbage looking) these people are forced to resign. Are the racist fascist pigs of the BNP forced to resign for their crimes? No - the fact that they have these convictions just makes them more appealing to the party and its supporters. I am a white woman born in England, but I have some genes splooshing around somewhere from my Grandparents who were Romanian - I presume that this means I am not welcome in this country? Absolute power corrupts.......who the hell are you (BNP supporters and party) to tell me I am not British? Get over yoursleves, your racist fascisism makes me, and many many other people, sick to the gut. You do not deserve a voice when that voice is used to incite hatred.</p>

	<p><em><strong>Tim</strong> replies:</em> Actuaaly, since BNP does not have much support at the grass root level that all they can do is start lousy post one after another. At the last count there were 23 - I would not vote because of no BNP here - kind of posts. As soon as they lose argument at one post, they start another. if there is no BNP candidate in your area, it means they have no support and if one of them was to stand, would have lost even his deposit. Tough but that's what it is at ground. Perhaps we should now just ignore their post, as responding to it - no matter how logically - is just encouraging them for more posts.</p>

	<p><em><strong>tiger43</strong> replies:</em> To  BNP............Face it, the BNP have exactly the same reasons as all the other parties for doing what they do. Getting your votes, so they can get some power for their own personal ends. Sure, by all means vote BNP, but just remember, it will be for their interests, not yours. </p>

	<p><em><strong>Anonymous</strong> replies:</em> Just a suggestion, but if all the BNP voters were to move to some small, insignificant constituency they might be able to muster enough support to actually get one of their own neanderthals elected.</p> <p>Mind you, most of them would probably still end up spoiling their ballot papers anyway. </p>
