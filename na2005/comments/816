	<p><em><strong>SM</strong> replies:</em> The Worlds Smallest Political Quiz is also the World's Most Simplistic.  On the Economic questions, at least. </p> <p>Right "libertarians" are blind to class, power and privilege.  They want to protect property for those who have it.  The choice isn't between state property or individual wealth (for some)*.  To pretend it is is to go down the restricted choice route the political parties would have us fall for.  </p> <p>*In truth, each of these options is ugly.</p> <p> </p>

	<p><em><strong>poweressence com</strong> replies:</em> I'm also libertarian, but I was very impressed by the Veritas Party today. They might be slightly right wing and populist  but you'll see if you look hard enough how the media blows them out of context. They certainly go some way to providing individual freedom by dropping taxes and abolishing the govt's silly plans to take away our civil liberties (eg ID cards). </p>

	<p><em><strong>Robbo</strong> replies:</em> Sm writes: "You were *what?* What was impressive? The tan?"</p> <p>I suspect the Vanitas Party were attractive cos of their bribe of lower taxation.  Please... Does Robert Kiljoy-Silk think we're really that shallow!</p>

	<p><em><strong>Somebloke</strong> replies:</em> In what way does having a piece of paper saying "I am Joe" (or whoever you are) impair your civil liberties?</p> <p>I keep not understanding this.</p>

	<p><em><strong>SJ</strong> replies:</em> It's not the fact that it's a piece of paper with your name on it, its more the biometric information, and the increased control that the government (and any private companies that it chooses) can exert over you as a result.</p>

	<p><em><strong>Ian Dunbar</strong> replies:</em> Robbo, You are missing the point, its not "The Piece of paper" its the symbolism, The Government are supposed to be our elected representatives, why do we go down on our knees thanking them for not raising this or that tax, what did I get for the quarter (actually it was more than that) of my salary that they TOOK last year, I know what my landlord gave me for the money I gave her, I know what  Tesco et al gave me for the money I gave them, I know what my Garage gave me for the money I gave them but what the hell do the government give me? I would give to charities if I had any left, I would pay for private health, private education even a Road Toll to road builders but just ask yourself Does Government give good value? And to the Simplistic comment There is no Right Libertarian here, Just plain Libertarian, Freedom for all irrespective of Race, Colour Creed snd Sex, No Rights, protected or otherwise only Liberty to pursue happiness, (note Pursue Not achieve)</p>

	<p><em><strong>Anonymous</strong> replies:</em> It's not the piece of paper, or even the symbolism. It IS the vast databases of information that WILL be collected behind it, both the main one the government will hold and those that corporations will collect on you based on the data they will be sold by the government. <br /></p>

	<p><em><strong>Ian D</strong> replies:</em> Right on anonymous, The real beauty of Libertarianism is that as long as we adhere to the belief that Integrity is Non Negotiable, then if we have real representatives and not Presidential style leaders we will all be better off, there are no privileged ones, only people who succeed and those that dont, everyone will have enough to follow their own convictions with respect to charity and support for those that do not succed or are in real need, we do not need "vast databases" of information on us, and just to throw some real hot potatoes about how far do you think the maniacs of 9/11 would have got if ALL the passengers on those aircraft had been armed?</p>

	<p><em><strong>Jax</strong> replies:</em> It's not now that there is a problem with ID cards, it's later, like the anti-terror laws.<br />I would actually trust New Labouur to not abuse the power they would gain with Anti-Terror Laws or Id cards (the ability to trace someone and their actions) HOWEVER, if say 30 years if a Hitler-esqe individual got in to power it would make it easy to turn this country into a dictatorship.</p> <p>That's why.</p>

	<p><em><strong>Gavin</strong> replies:</em> That's the same reason why the Royals should be stripped of their remaing power - the Queen is OK, but future "rulers" could use their remaining, still technically considerable, power to dangerous ends. It wouldn't make any difference to the tourism or anything else, frankly, it would just ensure our future safety.</p> <p>(I'll resist making any jokes about inbreeding leading to madness, etc).</p>
