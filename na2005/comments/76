These things have nothing whatsoever to do with their actual beliefs. If they then get voted in, they lie and cheat to stay in power.</p> <p>It's not 'apathy' (as the politicians like to call it), it's resentment. None of them deserves my vote. </p>

	<p><em><strong>Dave</strong> replies:</em> Richard, you don't seem to get the anger people fel. It's not just the existing parties that are a problem it's the whole system of party politics that people dislike. independants or new parties are (in most cases) defeated before they start, because they cannot get exposure (without huge amounts of money, meaning corporate sponsors and thus compromise), and no-one will vote for a party they have never heard. In fact very few stray from the two main parties simply because that's as much as the papers and the tv ever deal with.</p>

	<p><em><strong>dominic</strong> replies:</em> Dave, if you're that disenchanted it's entirely up to you to get off your bum and do something about it.  Set up a party that you think people will like, or run as an independent yourself.  If you don't like that, then help someone else do it, maybe by backing them finanacially.  Poltics is entirely open to new players in the market: if people want it to happen it will.  the media may not report a small party (why should they if no one supports it), but they will report one that wins elections or does well, and it's up to the hard work of individuals who care to make that happen. i work for the libdems and there are people coming into our office all the time to pick up leaflets for delivery.  These people care about Liberal values enough to go out in the rain spreading the word.  maybe there aren't more parties because none can motivate people in the same numbers as the big three, because, broadly, the big three represent the three main strands of political thought in the UK: Liberalism, Social Democracy and Conservatism.</p>

	<p><em><strong>Dave</strong> replies:</em> Why would I want to take part in a system that I consider flawed and unrepresentative when by abstaining from voting I register my view that the whole thing is bull?</p> <p>And Dominic, if you seriously think that anyone can get anywhere near the publicity of the big thre without some serious cash up front then you're very naive.</p> <p>There are more parties already. They have no money and noone votes for them because they don't know anything about them. Even if I had an army of people going door to door. Those that vote often do so mindlessly, and a lot of those that don't vote have genuine objections to the whole process.</p>

	<p><em><strong>Andy P</strong> replies:</em> Dave,</p> <p>You may think you're registering your view that the whole thing is bull, but who else knows this? Apart from the people visiting this site, who else registers your protest? Does your MP? Do the party leaders? Does the media? </p> <p>Or do they all mistake you for some apathetic git who's happy with the status quo?</p> <p>Don't vote if you don't want to; but if you want something to change, you have to do <strong>more than that.</strong></p>

		<h2>About Not Apathetic</h2>
<p>NotApathetic was built so that people who are planning not to vote
in the <acronym title="United Kingdom">UK</acronym> General Election
on May 5th can tell the world why. We won't try to persuade you that
voting is a good or a bad idea - we're just here to record and share
your explanations. Whether ideological,	practical or other, any	reason
will do.</p>

<!--<p><a href="/cgi-bin/similarity.cgi">Help us spot patterns in
submitted reasons</a> (by telling us whether two posts are similar or
not)</p>-->

<small>A lot of users would like us to
mention that if you spoil your ballot paper, it <em>will</em>
be counted. So if you want to record a vote for "none of the
above", you can.</small>
