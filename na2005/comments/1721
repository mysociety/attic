	<p><em><strong>Jeffrey</strong> replies:</em> Its mandatory in some countries.  And I think we could still get majority in our archaic first past the post system.  They wouldn't do it because of all those people who feel forced to vote will vote against the party that did that to them.</p>

	<p><em><strong>Andy P</strong> replies:</em> If you make voting mandatory, you get two problems.<br />1 - Enforcement. Think of the time and money that could be wasted chasing after people who hadn't voted.<br />2 - Apathy. If people don't want to vote, and you force them to vote, many will protest by casting a deliberately silly vote. Two possibilities follow. Either they vote for candidates with no chance - in which case, they may as well have not voted. Or, their joke candidate gets elected despite having no serious policies. I don't see how this will improve the quality of government.</p>

	<p><em><strong>Descartes</strong> replies:</em> I think that a major step forward in UK politics would be achieved if voting was compulsory - but only if the voting list allowed you to select "none of the above".  This would really bring home to politicians that the real world actually starts as you walk OUT of Westminster and leave the "Yes - men" behind.<br />Descates</p>

	<p><em><strong>Max</strong> replies:</em> I might be sympathetic to the idea of compulsory voting if it was also compulsory for all the parties standing to have equal access to the means of communication to state their case. In other words, a level playing field. As it stands, the largest parties or those with a benefactor with a large cheque book can muster up 50 candidates to entitle them to a 5 minute Party Election Broadcast. In fact, it usually works out at about 3-1/2 minutes.<br />This means that the electorate are denied the opportunity to make an informed decision to vote for, or against, a candidate.</p>

	<p><em><strong>Alex</strong> replies:</em> What a stupid post! "Please force me to vote."</p> <p>Why don't you just go and vote and pretend someone forced you to?</p> <p>Compulsory voting gives far too much importance to politicians and their farcical government. Worse stil, it deprives us of one of the most fundamental democratic rights. The right to turn our noses up at this ugly sham and register our disapproval of the whole system,</p>

	<p><em><strong>shoogle</strong> replies:</em> It's an odd one... I think that a lot of people actually vote WHILST being apathetic about the whole affair. <br />What would the apathetic do if ordered to vote?<br />Vote, of course; it's the path of least resistance.<br />Would (or do) the votes of those who don't actually give a monkey's present a mandate to govern them?<br />Why don't we force everyone to have an opinion on the matter too?<br />Compulsory voting shouldn't happen because it would force people into partaking in something they really didn't ask to be part of.<br />It couldn't happen in an open society (though God knows where one of those is) because it gives lie to the whole ludicrous system.<br />It won't happen here because nobody could tell how the missing 40 odd percent will vote.</p> <p>And tell Tiger43 I'd like a job as a polling clerk when that system comes to town....</p>

		<h2>About Not Apathetic</h2>
<p>NotApathetic was built so that people who are planning not to vote
in the <acronym title="United Kingdom">UK</acronym> General Election
on May 5th can tell the world why. We won't try to persuade you that
voting is a good or a bad idea - we're just here to record and share
your explanations. Whether ideological,	practical or other, any	reason
will do.</p>

<!--<p><a href="/cgi-bin/similarity.cgi">Help us spot patterns in
submitted reasons</a> (by telling us whether two posts are similar or
not)</p>-->

<small>A lot of users would like us to
mention that if you spoil your ballot paper, it <em>will</em>
be counted. So if you want to record a vote for "none of the
above", you can.</small>
