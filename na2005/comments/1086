	<p><em><strong>diplomatt</strong> replies:</em> am in a safe labour seat myself, which is fine with me, but i'll still vote to give my endorsement for one of the alternatives on offer.</p> <p>PR has as many problems as advantages - rather than a select few getting the candidate that they want, the chances are that the electorate will get a candidate they hate less, rather than one that anybody like. they've had PR in italy for ages, it leads to weak government, and deals struck AFTER elections between politicians which have little to do with what the people want anyway.</p> <p>as a general thing for this site, voting isn't the only way to be politically active, if issues matter there are a plethora pressure/select interest groups you can join you may find it a better way to achieve your aims</p>

	<p><em><strong>Sam</strong> replies:</em> Abolish party politics and there is no such thing as a safe seat.</p> <p>You vote for who you believe would best represent your constituency. Your member of parliament would have to vote on issues as his/her constituency wished or they'd be out of a job next time around.</p> <p>The party line is the shield your MP hides behind to avoid doing the right thing for your constituency.</p>

	<p><em><strong>Louise</strong> replies:</em> Maybe I shouldn't be on this site, as I will vote, as I always have, and as I believe everyone should.  I also live in a safe (Labour) seat.  I have not decided yet whether to vote Lib Dem or Green (or even - maybe but probably not - Respect).  None of those parties will win in my constituency.  However I do believe the two main parties will look seriously at the share of the vote they got, and where the rest of the vote went.  If the Green vote goes up by 2%, say, it probably will not lose Labour any seats at all, but if they want to win the next election they (and the other parties) will be looking at where they can pick up votes.  If they think bringing in one 'green' policy will buy that 2% of votes, then my vote will not have been in vain.</p> <p>That is why I will be voting, and I urge everyone else to do the same.</p>

		<h2>About Not Apathetic</h2>
<p>NotApathetic was built so that people who are planning not to vote
in the <acronym title="United Kingdom">UK</acronym> General Election
on May 5th can tell the world why. We won't try to persuade you that
voting is a good or a bad idea - we're just here to record and share
your explanations. Whether ideological,	practical or other, any	reason
will do.</p>

<!--<p><a href="/cgi-bin/similarity.cgi">Help us spot patterns in
submitted reasons</a> (by telling us whether two posts are similar or
not)</p>-->

<small>A lot of users would like us to
mention that if you spoil your ballot paper, it <em>will</em>
be counted. So if you want to record a vote for "none of the
above", you can.</small>
