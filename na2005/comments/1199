	<p><em><strong>ray</strong> replies:</em> I am pretty sure that you are not voting because you may not even exist. Better if you do not play into wrong hands. This site is supposed to be for mostly serious discussion.</p>

	<p><em><strong>Cohen</strong> replies:</em> Oh, you're so funny. Somewhere buried in that hilarious passage of yours, there's a horribly narrow, bigotted view of society, and a cynicism that stinks to high heaven. Maybe you'd have prefered to live in Nazi Germany. Have some respect. Ever been disabled? </p>

	<p><em><strong>John</strong> replies:</em> Nah, there's plenty of jokes, aggro, banter and downright idiocy in amongst all the serious discussion.</p> <p>But bigotry ain't funny.</p> <p>Or should I start a thread entitled "I'm not voting until complete subservience is made mandatory for all bitches and hos"?</p>

	<p><em><strong>Arf _</strong> replies:</em> Having just read all the response to the original tongue in cheek post.<br />I found it amusing and didn't detect any bigotry in it.</p> <p>Lets face it, it's truth there are 1000's of people in this country that fit that stereotype well maybe not the albanian lesbian part ...but milking the state and doing F_ck all to find a job or make some sort of contribution.</p> <p>When people state the truth they are called bigots?  <br />That's what is missing in this country / politics ... call a spade a spade.</p>

	<p><em><strong>james</strong> replies:</em> "milking the state"? the state acts in the interests of the rich. without the state the rich would not be rich and the poor would not be poor -- there would be no law enforcement agencies to ensure that there were such divisions. people "milking the state" is inevitable and, i think, justified -- until we live in a classless and free world, by which time there will be no state nor any need to steal.</p>

	<p><em><strong>Andy P</strong> replies:</em> James:</p> <p>Begins with B and ends with 'ollocks'.</p> <p>Without the state the rich would not be rich and the poor would not be poor? Yeah, right. Sure, no-one would have any cash - but the rich would still be rich and the poor would still be poor, in terms of time, possessions, power, health, liberty etc. Getting rid of 'the state' doesn't turn this place into paradise or make people into selfless, caring, sharing paragons of charity.</p> <p>The state can act in the interests of the rich or the interests of the poor or - in the real world - some compromise between the two. And don't get me started again on stealing...</p>

	<p><em><strong>Tiger43</strong> replies:</em> To poster.......Personally, I think the state isn`t giving you enough benifits and support. I am not ashamed to say that as I was reading your letter, tears were trickling down my cheeks with sadness at the terrible and uncaring way in which the authorities are treating you.</p> <p>There are too many unfortunates like youself in this country, who are unable through no fault of there own to sponge off society for everything it has. </p> <p>I would just like to take this opportunity to wish you luck in the future and hope that things start picking up for you soon.</p> <p>Lastly, do not allow some of the people on this forum from upsetting you. I would just like to end by wishing you a slow and painful death, and may your ashes be scattered in the nearest and most convenient sewer.<br /></p>

		<h2>About Not Apathetic</h2>
<p>NotApathetic was built so that people who are planning not to vote
in the <acronym title="United Kingdom">UK</acronym> General Election
on May 5th can tell the world why. We won't try to persuade you that
voting is a good or a bad idea - we're just here to record and share
your explanations. Whether ideological,	practical or other, any	reason
will do.</p>

<!--<p><a href="/cgi-bin/similarity.cgi">Help us spot patterns in
submitted reasons</a> (by telling us whether two posts are similar or
not)</p>-->

<small>A lot of users would like us to
mention that if you spoil your ballot paper, it <em>will</em>
be counted. So if you want to record a vote for "none of the
above", you can.</small>
