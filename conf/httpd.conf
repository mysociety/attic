# Apache configuration for NeWs interfaces
#
# Add lines something like this to your main /etc/apache/httpd.conf:
#
# # NeWs
# <VirtualHost *:80>
#     ServerName news.owl
#     DocumentRoot /home/louise/mysociety/news/web/
#     <Directory /home/louise/mysociety/news/web>
#         Include /home/louise/mysociety/news/conf/httpd.conf
#     </Directory>
#     Alias /admin/ /home/louise/mysociety/news/web-admin/
# </VirtualHost>
#
# You also need to enable .php files and .cgi files to run as PHP
# scripts and CGI scripts respectively.  For example:
#
#  Options +ExecCGI
#  AddHandler cgi-script .cgi
